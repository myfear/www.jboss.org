h2.divider About JavaLand
p  Itâ€™s time for the Java-Community to meet again: From March 24th to March 26th, 2015, the Java enthusiasts, developers, architects, strategists, administrators and project managers will continue to settle JavaLand. In Phantasialand, we want to see your brains on fire and your bellies well filled. We want to experience inspiring talks about Java technologies and hear you scream in the "Black Mamba". 

p  This young conference is in it's second year now and Red Hat believes this event is great for the Java community and is happy to announce, that we offer our support as a sponsor.
